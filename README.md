## Introduction
Tools designed to speed up the development process of a developer really come in handy when you dont have enough time on your hands to complete your project on time.
What if it ships with additional tools such as vanish for caching that will be useful in your app in future? This is worth a trial and that's why most developers recommend API platform for faster and better design and development of APIs.
In this tutorial, I will take you through how to create a simple API with CRUD operations on a ToDo list. 

## Prerequisites

2. Docker
3. Composer

## Setting Up API Platform
 - Clone the repository in the official API platform Github page
 - Pull and run API platform containers and take readers through the project structure
 
 ## Design and Create Entities
 - Create ToDo entities that will create the relevant tables for us in the database.
 - Inspect routes created
 
 ## Database Setup
 - Initialize the database.
 - Load fake data into the db.
